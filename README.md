- Notification badges for forum notifications. When the client is open, it will show notification badges on the taskbar icon if you have any. Similar to badges on the discord taskbar icon.
- Auto-pause. When you switch to another window, the game will automatically pause for you so that you don't wander off aimlessly and die.
- Built-in evolution tree. Tired of forgetting how to evolve to a certain animal? Well now you can see the evolution tree right from the game!
- External links open in your browser instead of in a new app window, unlike other clients.
- Exit confirmation. Just so that you don't get that "oh no I misclicked" moment and lose your 10M penguin run.
